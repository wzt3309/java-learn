# 1.1 Naming Beans

Every bean has one or more identifiers. These identifiers must be unique within the container that hosts the bean. A bean usually has only one identifier. **However, if it requires more than one, the extra ones can be considered aliases.**

> With component scanning in the classpath, Spring generates bean names for unnamed components, following the rules described earlier: essentially, taking the simple class name and turning its initial character to lower-case. However, in the \(unusual\) special case when there is more than one character and both the first and second characters are upper case, the original casing gets preserved. These are the same rules as defined by `java.beans.Introspector.decapitalize` \(which Spring uses here\).
